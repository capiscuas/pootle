Welcome!

You are receiving this email because you completed the registration for your new Pootle account.

No Language and no Projects selected:

You have not yet selected any language or projects for translation. As a result, we are sending this email to you in order to provide the info needed to complete your account selections.

To complete these selections and provide yourself access to the translation controls within Pootle, 
please log into Pootle, 
http://pootle.linguisticteam.org/accounts/login/

click on the Settings tab near the top of the resulting page 
http://pootle.linguisticteam.org/accounts/edit/

and add your selections to the Language, Projects and Alternate Language areas on the left. Multiple items can be selected by holding down the CTRL key while clicking on them. When you are finished, be sure to click on the Save button below those two selection areas on the left. Once your selections have been saved to the system, we will finally be able to set up your translation rights for those selections.

Note that the "Terminology" project is not translatable. It exists solely as internal Pootle function and should not be selected. Also, the English Proofreading project is specific to the English Proofreading Team and should not be selected unless you are an English Proofreading Team member. Finally, there is no need to select the English language or the Tutorial project in order to make use of our 'practice' area. The Tutorial project is open to everyone and does not require any special rights to access.
