and add your selections to the Language, Projects and Alternate Language areas on the left. Multiple items can be selected by holding down the CTRL key while clicking on them. When you are finished, be sure to click on the Save button below leaving the page. Once your selections have been saved to the system, we will finally be able to set up your translation rights for those selections.

The "Terminology" project is not yet translatable and should not be selected. Also, the "French Chapter" project is only there for members of the French Team while the English Proofreading project is specific to the English Proofreading Team and should not be selected unless you are an English proofreader. Finally, there is no need to select the English language or the Tutorial project in order to make use of our 'practice' area. The Tutorial project is open to everyone and does not require any rights to access.
